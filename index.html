		I found a love for me
Darling just dive right in, and follow my lead
I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
		
Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was, I will not give you up this time
But darling just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes you’re holding mine

Baby I’m dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling you look perfect tonight
